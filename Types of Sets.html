                <div class="font-sans text-center m-4 break-normal text-left text-sm/7">Lego Sets. These were the first offering from lego. The originals were quite basic by today's standards, but now you can get sets of any complexity for young builders as well as older ones.

                <div class="font-sans text-center m-4 break-normal text-left text-sm/7">Lego minifigures. These are most commonly known as 'minifigs'. originally were sold with sets, but have grown to be sold independantly. There are now series of minifigs to collect, and these have been wildly popular since introduction.

                <div class="font-sans text-center m-4 break-normal text-left text-sm/7">Lego Technic. This form of lego focuses more on mechanical principles, like building a car engine that moves the wheels. It introduced many new parts to lego including gears, cogs, axels, and beams. Over time, this grew to include pneumatic pumps, tubing and actuators. This allows technic to produce more interesting mechanisms for the models.

                <div class="font-sans text-center m-4 break-normal text-left text-sm/7">Free Lego. This is loose lego, designed to just be played with rather than making a set. This is often looked down on by set collecters, but free lego allows you to build whatever you want to build. This engages a different part of your mind to building a set.
