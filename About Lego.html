        <div class="font-sans text-center m-4 break-normal text-left text-sm/7">Let's be honest to begin with. If you have found this blogsite, you likely already know what Lego is.
            But, it wouldn't be much of an introduction without information. And so, we will begin.</div>
        <div class="font-sans text-center m-4 break-normal text-left text-sm/7">Lego is a building toy comprised of small plastic elements that can be interlocked together to form larger structures.
            There are now several competitors to lego, but none surpass the original.</div>
        <div class="font-sans text-center m-4 break-normal text-left text-sm/7">In general, there are flat plates, blocks, and studs which can be used to make models. Over time, the need for more and more specialty pieces rose, and now you can get most shapes in lego.</div>
        <div class="font-sans text-center m-4 break-normal text-left text-sm/7">Lego technic was also introduced, which has more focus on gears and engineering. This form of lego allows you to make more technical models like engines with moving pistons and gearboxes in plastic. They introduced rods, axels, gearbox elements as well as cogs to help simulate real engines.</div>
        <div class="font-sans text-center m-4 break-normal text-left text-sm/7">The larger sets incorporate elements from both traditional lego and lego technic to make a model with accurate engine parts, and accurate bodywork.</div>
